# Extra things that you may want to know

1. Tipping
- At restaurants
  - If you get takeaway food, or if you're required to head to a counter to order food, collect your own food and clear your tray, you're not required to tip.
  - If table service is provided, tip based on how well is the service rendered.
- For Uber/Lyft
  - Tip based on how well the service is rendered. They don't earn much, and sometimes below minimum wage.
  
2. Random small talks
- Anywhere
  - It's common for people to have random small talks everywhere you go in America. Don't be alarmed or feel creeped out. 

3. California Driving Culture
- Bay Area / Los Angeles
  - People drive like retards. The hours spent sitting in SF traffic during rush hour burns all the patience of even the kindest driver away. Be careful, firm, but not aggressive when driving.
- In the event of an accident
  - Check if everyone is ok, and if there's a need to call 911.
  - DO NOT ADMIT FAULT. Exchange insurance details and leave.
- Bay area bridge and express lane tolls
  - Apply for fasTrak for shorter wait times and the eligibility to use the HOV lane during peak hours. https://www.bayareafastrak.org/
